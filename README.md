# RGB-Plate-AD-Diagnosis-Tool
RGB Plate Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosing Web Application Tool.

The RGB plate application was developed using visual studio code (https://code.visualstudio.com/), an integrated development environment streamlined code editor with support for development operations. The software was developed using cascading style sheets (CSS), hypertext markup language (HTML) , and javascript (JS) programing languages. It was developed as a web-application stand-alone software on a tablet PC Android 9 Knox version 3.3 10.5-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab A 260 × 161.1 × 8mm for easy visualization and handling for the participants. The web application was self-administration, and the recording of the RGB values was store in the tablet storage as soon as the participant contacted the last RGB value, which could be downloaded as a "CSV" file for further statistical analysis. For example, the application could be accessed from the link (https://rgb-plate-ad-diagnosis-tool.web.app/) with source codes in the GitHub repository (). Figure 2 shows the four red-blue spectra integrated into the tablet PC.
